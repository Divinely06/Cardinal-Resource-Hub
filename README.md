## Approval Flow

`Organization submission → Faculty review → Maintenance handling → Admin review → Dean final decision → Approved`

The Dean is the final authority for budget, policy, and campus-rule decisions. Admin manages the resources and performs the operational review immediately before the Dean's decision.
